Homework 8

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.4302926296296296
after Problem 6,
GC-content: 0.43059987061138255

Problem 3:

NameError. Commenting out the lines where the variable is being defined, caused a NameError when the variable is called at a different line. Commenting out the "gc_count = 0" would cause the same error because the variable gc_count is called later in the program.

Problem 4:

AT-content: 0.5689938518518518
after Problem 6,
AT-content: 0.5694001293886175

Problem 5:

A-count: 7701287
T-count: 7661547
G-count: 5738773
C-count: 5879128

Problem 6:

In sample_1.fastq, the Sum count, and Total count was different.
Sum count was 26980735 and total count was 27000000
There are 'N's in the sequence. Therefore, it adds more counts to total than needed for calculating GC-content. The program was incorrectly computing GC content.

Problem 7:

AT/GC ratio: 1.3223416174746196

Problem 8:

GC Classification: moderate GC content

Collaboration:

No help

Reflection:

I learned about DNA codes. Unsure why there are 'N's in the codes but knowning this ahead of time would have saved me some time on problem 6. Spend some time trying to figure out why I was getting the different sum count as total count.
