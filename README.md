About me
-----------
 
### Childhood
 
I grew up in [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea) until I was in 5th grade. That's when I came to the United States. Moving around quiet a bit, I made friends through technology and video games. That's probably when I decided I wanted to learn to program and make games. Unfortunately, I wasn't really committed in college and ended up majoring in Mathematics.

### Adulthood

Currently, I am a Network Engineer. I want to further explore the networking field, but at the same time explore the field I always wanted when I was a kid. I hope to learn to program better through this experience and maybe learn more about myself as well to decide if this is the career I want to grow in.
